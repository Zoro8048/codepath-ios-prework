### Idea

#### App Name: MoodSync â€“ A Mental Health Companion App

MoodSync would be a mental health and wellness app focusing on mood tracking, self-reflection, and mindful activities. Users could log their moods and activities daily, and the app would provide insights over time. It would include a blend of mental wellness practices such as guided journalizing, short relaxation exercises, and reminders to check in throughout the day. One key feature would be mood-based playlists integrated with Spotify to provide music that aligns with or lifts the user's mood. Additionally, a gratitude journal feature would encourage positive reflections. The app could also include a community feature where users anonymously share encouraging notes or achievements, creating a supportive and motivational environment.

## Notes
